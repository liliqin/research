		<h1>Cellular radiation responses and radiation resistance in cancer therapy</h1>

		<div class="text">
			<p>Mammalian cells are able to induce an adaptive response under certain genotoxic stress conditions including ionizing radiation to enhance their survival. DNA damage is one of the major radiation-induced cell events, while DNA repair is necessary for cell's survival. It is well known that DNA repair is an energy-consuming process, which indicates that mitochondria is possibly involved in radiation-induced DNA damage repair. </p>
			<p>My recent study found that sublethal dose (5 Gy) of radiation enhances mitochondrial ATP generation in normal cells, which is paralleled with enhanced mitochondrial relocation of cell cycle kinase CDK1 and nuclear DNA repair capacity. Further, mitochondria targeting expression of kinase-deficient mutant CDK1 significantly reverses radiation-enhanced mitochondrial ATP generation and inhibits DNA repair; overexpression of CDK1 phosphorylation-deficient mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (CI) subunits compromises radiation-enhanced mitochondria ATP generation. These results indicate a novel mechanism regulating communication between mitochondrial bioenergetics and nuclear DNA damage repair under genotoxic stress conditions, by which mitochondria-relocated CDK1 boosts ATP generation to meet the increased fuel demand for DNA repair. </p>
			<p>Low dose radiation Hyperradiosensitity (HRS) and Increased Radioresistance (IRR) are typical cellular adaptive radiation responses observed in most cancer cells, which caused a higher radioresisance in cancer radiotherapy following guidance of CT scan. In my recent study, Cyclin D1/CDK4 is found relocated in mitochondria under low dose ionizing radiation, where it phosphorylates MnSOD, causing enhanced MnSOD activity and mitochondrial respiration, allowing cells to sense environmental genotoxic stress to improve cell survival. This finding shed light on the mechanisms underlying cellular adaptive protection under oxidative stress conditions and will help to design the novel approaches to target recurrence of radioresistant tumor and protect normal cells from radiation-associated injury. </p>
			<p>Accumulating evidence indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to tumor radioresistance. Our recent work established fractionated ionizing radiation (FIR)-surviving cells from multiple types of tumor cells. This FIR-surviving fraction represents stem cell and aggressiveness features, suggesting its role in cancer radioresistance and relapse. RNA-seq data showed that a group of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins implicated in mitochondrial energy metabolism is upregulated in FIR-surviving breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), suggesting the possibility of the enhanced mitochondrial energy production in these cells. Actually, We found that mitochondrial ATP generation is altered in the FIR-surviving cells compared to their parental cells, and that another single dose of sublethal dose of radiation increased the mitochondrial ATP level in FIR-surviving colon cancer cells, providing evidence that the FIR-surviving stem-like cancer cells may also shift their energy production from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism of these radioresistant cells will help to develop the new strategies and targets to improve the outcome of cancer radiation therapy. </p>

		<h1>Identification of <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements of <em>nautilus</em> gene in <em>Drosophila</em></h1>

		<div class="text text-1">
			<p>A <em>cis</em>-regulatory element is a region of non-coding DNA sequence in or near a gene required for proper 
				spatiotemporal expression of that gene, often containing binding sites for transcription 
				factors. We identified <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements of nautilus gene in <em>Drosophila</em> 
				as a start to study how this gene's expression is regulated. Using a comparative genomics tool, 
				EvoPrinter, I identified 11 candidate cis-regulatory elements of nautilus gene, which are 
				evolutionarily conserved in 12 Drosophila genomes.</p>

			<p>Gene targeting is a genetic technique that uses homologous recombination to change an endogenous 
				gene.Ends-in makes use of p-element transposon insertion, FLP-FRT site-specific recombination 
				system, I-SceI rare-cutting endonuclease mediated DSB and homologous recombination (HR) repair 
				system to target desired mutation into the interest locus in the genome (Rong, Y. Science, 288, 
				2013-2018, 2000). 
				PhiC31 integrase mediates sequence-directed, irreversible and highly efficient integration between 
				a bacterial attachment site (attB) and a phage attachment site (attP). 
				SIRT combines phiC31-mediated site-specific 
				integration and ends-in targeting to generate mutations of a gene at its endogenous locus.  
				An attP site is firstly targeted to the interest locus through ends-in targeting and subsequent 
				reduction. Further modifications of the same locus are introduced by integration of an 
				attB-containing plasmid with a modified target locus. Thereafter, a series of modification of the 
				same target locus can be introduced repeatedly with once attP placement step. It is a laber- and 
				time-saving tool that allows repeated modifications of a gene, including single amino acid 
				replacements, small domain deletion and complete deletion (Gao, G. PNAS, 105(37), 13999 –14004, 2008).</p>

			<p>	Using SIRT, I established a transgenic fly line with an attP site inserted into nautilus gene 
				in Drosophila genome, which makes it easier to study the functions of nautilus gene by repeatedly 
				introducing a series of modifications in a time- and labor-saving way. It has been used in a study 
				for deletion of entire 3’UTR region and mutations of some candidate miRNA binding sites to verify 
				the targeting effect of series of miRNAs on nautilus gene.In addition, since no commercial ChIP grade 
				antibody to nautilus available, introducing a tag to nautilus using this fly line will make it possible 
				to screening nautilus target genes using anti-tag antibody</p>

		<div class="text">
			<p>Aurora-A, as a cell cycle regulator, has been reported
			overexpressed in many types of cancers, leading to centrosome
			amplification and aneuploidy, which can be a driving cause of
			genomic instability and tumorigenesis. I found that
			overexpression of Aurora-A delays Cyclin B1 degradation,
			resulting in an increased Cyclin B1 protein level; while Aurora-
			A RNAi enhances Cyclin B1 degradation. Further study
			showed that Aurora-A interacts with Cyclin B1 and inhibits
			ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Cyclin B1, which depends
			on Aurora-A kinase activity. These results provide new insight
			into the mechanism of how deregulated Aurora-A contributes to
			genomic instability and carcinogenesis.</p>

		<div class="text">
			<p>Antibodies are host proteins that are produced by the immune system in response to foreign 
				molecules that enter the body. These foreign molecules are called antigens, and their 
				molecular recognition by the immune system results in selective production of antibodies 
				that are able to bind the specific antigen. Antibodies are made by B-lymphocytes and 
				circulate throughout the blood and lymph where they bind to their specific antigen, 
				enabling it to be cleared from circulation.	This ability of animal immune systems to 
				produce antibodies capable of binding specifically to antigens can be harnessed to 
				manufacture probes for detection of molecules of interest in a variety of research and 
				diagnostic applications.</p>
			<p>Antibody production involves preparation of antigen samples and their safe injection into 
				laboratory or farm animals so as to evoke high expression levels of antigen-specific 
				antibodies in the serum, which can then be recovered from the animal. Polyclonal antibodies 
				are recovered directly from serum (bleeds). Monoclonal antibodies are produced by fusing 
				antibody-secreting spleen cells from immunized mice with immortal myeloma cell to create 
				monoclonal hybridoma cell lines that express the specific antibody and secrete into cell 
				culture supernatant.</p>
			<p>Using cTn-I protein isolated from patient heart or commercially synthesized cTn-I polypeptied, we produced
				high titer rabbit polyclonal antibodies and mouse monoclonal antibodies against human cTn-I, which can be
				used in lab research or clinical diagnosis.</p>
