		<h1>Cellular radiation response and radiation resistance in cancer therapy</h1>
		<p class="meta">2013 - 2015 <br />Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, California</p>
		<div class="text">
			<p>Mammalian cells are able to induce an adaptive response under certain genotoxic stress conditions 
				including ionizing radiation to enhance their survival. Mitochondrial homeostasis is proven 
				actively involved in radiation induced cellular adaptive response. Elucidation of the mechanisms 
				underlying radiation-induced mitochondrial homeostasis will be helpful to improve the outcome of 
				tumor radiotherapy and protect normal cells from radiation-associated injury.</p>
			<p>Recently, I found that sublethal dose (5 Gy) of radiation enhances mitochondrial ATP generation 
				in normal cells, which is paralleled with enhanced mitochondrial relocation of cell cycle kinase 
				CDK1 and nuclear DNA repair capacity. More interestingly, mitochondria targeting expression of 
				kinase deficient mutant CDK1 significantly reverses radiation-enhanced mitochondrial ATP generation 
				and inhibits DNA repair; overexpression of CDK1 phosphorylation deficient mitochondrial respiratory 
				chain complex I (CI) subunits compromises radiation-enhanced mitochondria ATP generation. These 
				results indicate a unique mechanism governing the communication between mitochondria and nucleus, 
				in which mitochondria-relocated CDK1 boosts cellular bioenergetics to meet the increased cellular 
				fuel demand for DNA repair and cell survival under genotoxic stress (1).</p>
			<p>	I also found that sublethal dose of radiation induces a feature of energy shift from glycolysis 
				to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial enrichment of Cyclin B1/CDK1 in 
				multiple types of tumor cells including breast cancer, colon cancer and glioma brain tumor cells 
				(6) (and unpublished data). CDK1-mediated post-translational modulation (phosphorylation) of 
				mitochondrial proteins (e.g. SIRT3, MnSOD, Survivin) results in enhanced	mitochondrial	
				bioenergetics	and	mitochondria homeostasis, which may contribute to the adaptive radioresistance 
				in cancer cells (3). In addition, Cyclin D1/CDK4 is also found relocated in mitochondria under 
				low dose ionizing radiation, where it phosphorylates MnSOD, causing enhanced MnSOD activity and 
				mitochondrial respiration, allowing cells to sense environmental genotoxic stress to improve cell 
				survival (5). The results from these studies shed light on the mechanisms underlying cellular 
				adaptive protection under oxidative stress conditions and will help to design the novel approaches 
				to target radioresistant recurrent and metastasis tumor of patients and protect normal cells from 
				radiation-associated injury.</p>
			<p>A substantial amount of cyclinB1/Cdk1 is found by our group localized in the mitochondrial matrix of 
				cells, which is further enriched at late G2 phase of cell cycle. CDK1 phosphorylates a cluster of 
				mitochondrial complex I subunits and upregulates complex I activity to enhance mitochondrial ATP 
				production to meet the increased energy demand for G2/M transition. This work for the first 
				demonstrated that in addition to its well- defined nuclear function as a cell cycle checkpoint 
				protein, CDK1 also function in mitochondria to boost cellular energy production, allowing cells to 
				sense and respond to increased energy demand for G2/M transition for successful cell-cycle 
				progression (2, 7).</p> 
			<p>	Accumulating evidence indicated that cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to tumor radioresistance, 
				but the mechanisms is not clear. I recently established fractionated ionizing radiation 
				(FIR)-surviving cells from multiple types of tumor cells. This FIR-surviving fraction represents 
				stem cell and aggressiveness features, suggesting its role in cancer radioresistance and relapse. 
				RNA-seq data show that a group of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins implicated in mitochondrial 
				energy metabolism is upregulated in FIR-surviving breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), suggesting the 
				possibility of the enhanced mitochondrial energy production in these cells. Actually, I found that 
				mitochondrial ATP generation is altered in the FIR-surviving cells compared to their parental cells, 
				and that another single dose of sublethal dose of radiation increases the mitochondrial ATP level 
				in FIR-surviving colon cancer cells, providing evidence that the FIR-surviving stem-like cancer 
				cells may also shift their energy production from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative 
				phosphorylation. The elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of mitochondrial 
				energy metabolism of these radioresistant cells will help to develop the new strategies and targets 
				to improve the outcome of cancer radiation therapy.</p>

		<h1>Identification of <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements of <em>nautilus</em> gene in <em>Drosophila</em></h1>

		<div class="text text-1">
			<p>A <em>cis</em>-regulatory element is a region of non-coding DNA sequence in or near a gene required for proper 
				spatiotemporal expression of that gene, often containing binding sites for transcription

				as a start to study how this gene's expression is regulated. Using a comparative genomics tool, 
				EvoPrinter, I identified 11 candidate cis-regulatory elements of nautilus gene, which are

			<p>Gene targeting is a genetic technique that uses homologous recombination to change an endogenous 
				gene.Ends-in makes use of p-element transposon insertion, FLP-FRT site-specific recombination 
				system, I-SceI rare-cutting endonuclease mediated DSB and homologous recombination (HR) repair 
				system to target desired mutation into the interest locus in the genome (Rong, Y. Science, 288, 
				2013-2018, 2000). 
				PhiC31 integrase mediates sequence-directed, irreversible and highly efficient integration between 
				a bacterial attachment site (attB) and a phage attachment site (attP). 
				SIRT combines phiC31-mediated site-specific 
				integration and ends-in targeting to generate mutations of a gene at its endogenous locus.  
				An attP site is firstly targeted to the interest locus through ends-in targeting and subsequent 
				reduction. Further modifications of the same locus are introduced by integration of an 
				attB-containing plasmid with a modified target locus. Thereafter, a series of modification of the 
				same target locus can be introduced repeatedly with once attP placement step. It is a laber- and 
				time-saving tool that allows repeated modifications of a gene, including single amino acid 
				replacements, small domain deletion and complete deletion (Gao, G. PNAS, 105(37), 13999 –14004, 2008).</p>

			<p>	Using SIRT, I established a transgenic fly line with an attP site inserted into nautilus gene 
				in Drosophila genome, which makes it easier to study the functions of nautilus gene by repeatedly 
				introducing a series of modifications in a time- and labor-saving way. It has been used in a study 
				for deletion of entire 3’UTR region and mutations of some candidate miRNA binding sites to verify 
				the targeting effect of series of miRNAs on nautilus gene.In addition, since no commercial ChIP grade 
				antibody to nautilus available, introducing a tag to nautilus using this fly line will make it possible 
				to screening nautilus target genes using anti-tag antibody</p>

			<p>Aurora-A, as a cell cycle regulator, has been reported
			overexpressed in many types of cancers, leading to centrosome
			amplification and aneuploidy, which can be a driving cause of

			A RNAi enhances Cyclin B1 degradation. Further study
			showed that Aurora-A interacts with Cyclin B1 and inhibits
			ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Cyclin B1, which depends
			on Aurora-A kinase activity. These results provide new insight

			<p>Antibodies are host proteins that are produced by the immune system in response to foreign 
				molecules that enter the body. These foreign molecules are called antigens, and their 
				molecular recognition by the immune system results in selective production of antibodies 
				that are able to bind the specific antigen. Antibodies are made by B-lymphocytes and 
				circulate throughout the blood and lymph where they bind to their specific antigen, 
				enabling it to be cleared from circulation.	This ability of animal immune systems to 
				produce antibodies capable of binding specifically to antigens can be harnessed to 
				manufacture probes for detection of molecules of interest in a variety of research and 
				diagnostic applications.</p>
			<p>Antibody production involves preparation of antigen samples and their safe injection into 
				laboratory or farm animals so as to evoke high expression levels of antigen-specific 
				antibodies in the serum, which can then be recovered from the animal. Polyclonal antibodies 
				are recovered directly from serum (bleeds). Monoclonal antibodies are produced by fusing 
				antibody-secreting spleen cells from immunized mice with immortal myeloma cell to create 
				monoclonal hybridoma cell lines that express the specific antibody and secrete into cell 
				culture supernatant.</p>
			<p>Using cTn-I protein isolated from patient heart or commercially synthesized cTn-I polypeptied, we produced
				high titer rabbit polyclonal antibodies and mouse monoclonal antibodies against human cTn-I, which can be
				used in lab research or clinical diagnosis.</p>
